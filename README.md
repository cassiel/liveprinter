*Livecoding meets 3D printing: experiments in live computational sculpting*

LivePrinter is a live, immediate system for combining the design and 3D printing of objects. Livecoding is used to control manufacturing precisely and procedurally with real-time flexibility. It brings improvisation and intuition to the act of making new computational forms.

The current software toolchains of 3D printing place the artist and designer at a difficult distance from the physical process of making.  There is little space for live improvisation and experimentation, especially with key properties that directly affect printing materials, like temperature and print speeds.

This project is about developing an open, interactively programmed 3D printing system for live computational making. The system extends digital printing and CNC machining into the realm of performance and also has potential in design and science pedagogy.
